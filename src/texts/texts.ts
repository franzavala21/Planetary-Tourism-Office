const textos = [ { titulo : " Venus ", text : "It is one of the most inhospitable and extreme planets in our solar system due to its dense and hot atmosphere. Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun and is similar in size and composition to the Earth. It has a diameter of approximately 12,104 kilometers, making it barely slightly smaller than our planet. Like Earth, Venus is composed mainly of rocks and metals. Venus has an extremely dense and toxic atmosphere, composed mainly of carbon dioxide with traces of nitrogen and other gases. This dense atmosphere traps the sun's heat into an uncontrolled greenhouse effect, making the surface temperature the highest of any planet in the solar system, reaching around 465 degrees Celsius. (869 grados Fahrenheit). Due to its dense atmosphere, the pressure on the surface of Venus is more than 90 times that of the Earth. This would equal the pressure you would feel at a depth of almost 900 meters underwater on Earth. Venus has a retrograde rotation, which means it rotates in the opposite direction to most other planets in the solar system. Its day is longer than its year, with a full rotation taking about 243 Earth days, while its orbit around the Sun takes about 225 Earth days.",
