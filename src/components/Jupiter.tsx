            Get ready for an unparalleled adventure on a tourist trip to
            Jupiter, the gas giant of the solar system. Although it is not
            possible to land on the surface of Jupiter due to its dense
            atmosphere and lack of a solid surface, you can enjoy an exciting
            experience in its vicinity.

            Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and is a gas giant
            composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. Its diameter is
            approximately 139,822 kilometers, which is more than 11 times the
            diameter of the Earth. Jupiter's atmosphere is extremely dense and
            consists mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium, with traces of
            other gases such as methane, ammonia, water vapour and other
            compounds.

            Jupiter has a large number of moons, with more than 80 known moons
            to date. Some of Jupiter's largest and most interesting moons
            include Io, Europa, Ganymede and Calisto. Europe, in particular, has
            been of scientific interest because of the possibility that it has a
            subsurface ocean that could harbor life. Although Jupiter's rings
            are not as impressive as those of Saturn, the planet has a system of
            rings made up of dust particles. These rings are difficult to see
            from Earth and were discovered by spacecraft.
